_Creaturely Life_ takes its title from a chapbook of twenty poems by Michael Joyce, written from
the perspective of a woman wading through the Allhallowtide of a cherished marriage while
she keeps vigil over her dying husband.

According to Lageniensis, in Ireland on Hallow-eve “young females go out at midnight, and
cast a ball of yarn into the bottom of a lime-kiln, whist holding on by a thread. [...] If she feel it
pulled from her, she asks, “Who pulls my yarn?” when it is supposed her future husband will
give his name.” Inspired by the final poem of the series in which a wife finds solace knitting
beside her husband’s hospice bed, _Creaturely Life_ offers a tangible interface through which
the reader shares in the bottoming-out of loss and the unravelling of grief and love.

An installation at heart, _Creaturely Life_ is both intimate and personal. A table, chair, and desk
lamp occupy a quiet, soft-lit room. A crank-driven yarn ball winder and an umbrella swift are
clamped to either side of the table. Between them sit a screen and a wide-mouth glass jar
containing a single ball of yarn, one among a collection of twenty in varying sizes and colors,
each corresponding to a poem in the series.

The reader sits, clasps a section of yarn lightly between her fingers, and begins turning the
crank on the ball winder. Spun wool slides in a continuous stream across her fingers as
evanescent fragments of poetry flit about the screen, hinting at the hidden pattern of woven
language beneath. Reading and winding converge, fusing into a single experience. The ball in
the glass jar jostles about, shrinking in size, and the user -- much as the grieving bedside wife
in the poems -- draws ever closer to what knitters and sailors describe as "casting off," when
abruptly and without warning the last of the wool slips through the fingers and for the first
time the poem shows itself in its entirety. Much as a life slips into memory, the original ball of
yarn has transmogrified into a physical reflection of its former self, waiting to be slid off the
spindle. The reader is invited to unwind another poem or stand and take their leave.

Despite advances in haptic display technologies, as readers we retain a nostalgia for the
weight and texture of paper, the unmistakable sound of the turning of a page, the orderly
transfer of pages from one hand to the other. One fondles the page, “feels” their way through
the text in an effort to “grasp” its meaning. _Creaturely Life_ offers an unlikely analogue to the
pleasures of traditional text without resorting to web-based conventions, skeuomorphic
simulacra, or meddlesome interjections prompting the reader to choose. Here, the crank
evokes the passage of time, the wobbling spool spinning off-axis conjures visions of an orrery,
cycles within cycles, an interface befitting poems about death and dying. A deliberate
un-becoming and becoming again. The poem revealed in its entirety is the final unveiling. Not
closure, but completion.
